Generally speaking, there are four types of searching: `all, search, jav, video`, you can use these type plus value to search. The results will be written into a new json file.

- `yarn start search <query>` - common search
- `yarn start jav <jav id>` - search by jav id
- `yarn start video <video id>` - search by database video id
